//Here me out: Perhaps what happened that caused all of these things to happen(Kris' motive, Asgore's divorce and termination, Dess in the "void") was Asgore letting Dess die. 

//Ramble incoming:

//What if some sort of dark world opened up in the bunker while Dess and Kris were in their for certain reasons, "probably Gaster or the tailed individual from the twisted ramblings in Chapter 4". Perhaps Asgore could only save one of the kids and in the end he chose Kris. This could explain why certain people have different opinions of him like Rudy understanding his choice while Toriel despises him for not saving both of them or just not believing him. This can even explain Kris' motive in why they are helping Carol. The Chapter 4 Therapy Room shows how Kris has PTSD from some tramatic experience and that, perhaps, the egg man and the tree are simply manifestations of their guilt for inadvertedly causing Dess' death. If that is the case then perhaps Kris helping Carol is some form of them trying to make amends for their actions. It could even explain why Kris keeps us around because maybe they're the reason Dess went into the bunker and they don't want to be able to make descisions on their own due to them fearing their actions will lead to other people getting hurt and that they can use us as a scapegoat for their actions.
